## Phase 7: Testing and Coverage Improvements

- [ ] Temporary Deactivation of Failing Tests
  - Deactivate `test_validator`, `test_compliance_checking`, and `test_critical_violations` to isolate issues.

- [ ] Run All Tests Again
  - Execute all tests after deactivation to establish a new baseline for coverage.

- [ ] Investigate Errors
  - Analyze logs and error messages from failed tests to identify root causes.

- [ ] Implement Fixes
  - Make necessary modifications to address identified issues based on investigation.

- [ ] Re-run Tests
  - Execute all tests again after implementing fixes to ensure correctness and improved coverage.

### Temporary Deactivation of Tests
- **Deactivated Tests**:
  - `test_validator` in `tests/test_safety_constraints.py`
  - `test_compliance_checking` in `tests/test_safety_verification.py`
  - `test_critical_violations` in `tests/test_safety_verification.py`

### Steps for Reactivation
1. Reactivate `test_validator` after resolving logging issues.
2. Investigate and fix issues in `test_compliance_checking` and `test_critical_violations`, then reactivate them.

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Write failing test for new feature
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor while maintaining tests
4. Commit with semantic message
5. Repeat for next feature

### Git Workflow
1. Feature branches from main
2. Regular small commits
3. PR with passing tests
4. Code review
5. Merge to main

### Quality Standards
- 95% test coverage for core
- All features TDD
- Documentation up-to-date
- Clean git history

## Project Analysis (December 2024)

### Current State Assessment

Our technical review has identified several critical areas requiring immediate attention to transform the current theoretical framework into a production-ready implementation:

#### 1. Missing Critical Components
- No tests for the analytics module
- No integration with core SACP features
- No actual implementation of safety constraints
- No error handling or validation

#### 2. Code Issues
- Over-engineered class structures
- Unrealistic data models
- Missing practical implementation details
- No real-world use cases

#### 3. Documentation Problems
- Documentation describes features that aren't implemented
- Tutorials show idealized scenarios
- No real deployment guides
- Missing error handling docs

#### 4. Integration Gaps
- No connection to IDE extensions
- No CI/CD integration
- No actual multi-tenant support
- Missing security implementations

## Next Steps

1. Focus on implementing core functionality before adding more features
2. Create comprehensive test suite
3. Set up proper integrations and infrastructure
4. Add practical, real-world features

## Safety Principles
Throughout all phases, we maintain these core safety principles:

1. **Explicit Over Implicit**
   - All AI actions must be explicitly authorized
   - No hidden or automatic modifications
   - Clear documentation of capabilities

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Default to most restrictive access
   - Granular permission controls
   - Progressive privilege escalation

3. **Verifiable Safety**
   - All changes must be validated
   - Comprehensive audit trails
   - Reproducible safety checks

4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
   - Safe failure modes
   - Automatic rollback capabilities
   - Emergency stop functionality

5. **Transparency**
   - Clear logging of all actions
   - Explainable decisions
   - Visible safety boundaries

## Success Metrics
- Zero unauthorized modifications
- 100% validation coverage
- < 1% false positive rate
- < 100ms safety check latency
- 99.9% uptime for safety systems
- < 5% CPU overhead for monitoring
- < 100MB memory footprint
- 100% snapshot restoration success rate

## Safety Principles
Throughout all phases, we maintain these core safety principles:

1. **Explicit Over Implicit**
   - All AI actions must be explicitly authorized
   - No hidden or automatic modifications
   - Clear documentation of capabilities

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Default to most restrictive access
   - Granular permission controls
   - Progressive privilege escalation

3. **Verifiable Safety**
   - All changes must be validated
   - Comprehensive audit trails
   - Reproducible safety checks

4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
   - Safe failure modes
   - Automatic rollback capabilities
   - Emergency stop functionality

5. **Transparency**
   - Clear logging of all actions
   - Explainable decisions
   - Visible safety boundaries

## Success Metrics
- Zero unauthorized modifications
- 100% validation coverage
- < 1% false positive rate
- < 100ms safety check latency
- 99.9% uptime for safety systems

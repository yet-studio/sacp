## Quick Start

1. Install SACP:
   ```bash
   pip install sacp
   ```

2. Configure safety policy:
   ```yaml
   # sacp-config.yml
   safety_level: controlled_modify
   validation_rules:
     - pattern: "rm -rf"
       action: block
     - pattern: "sudo"
       action: warn
   ```

3. Initialize in your project:
   ```python
   from sacp import SafetyProtocol
   
   protocol = SafetyProtocol.from_config("sacp-config.yml")
   protocol.enable()
   ```
